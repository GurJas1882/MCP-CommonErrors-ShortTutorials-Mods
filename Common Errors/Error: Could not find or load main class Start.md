# Error: Could not find or load main class Start
Does the file `Start.java` exist? If it doesn't then decompile MCP again. 

If `Start.java` exists then double check that you have JDK 8, if you don't then download it from [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). Once you've downloaded it change your project jdk to the newly downloaded one. If you decompiled MCP with a different JDK besides 8 you have to decompile MCP again.
